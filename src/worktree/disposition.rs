//! PR-D · D1 — the single `terminal_disposition` classifier (janitor spike §1).
//!
//! Today the worktree-cleanup / GC-retention / auto-release paths each run their
//! OWN "is this terminal?" decision (spike §0: three decision systems over six
//! kill-paths). This module is the unified DECISION seam they will share: one
//! pure classifier that maps a worktree's resolved signals to one of four
//! dispositions. It is **pure by construction** — every I/O-derived signal is an
//! INPUT, computed by the caller. The impure signal-gathering stays in each
//! system; D2–D4 wire the call sites (this D1 slice is purely additive and has
//! ZERO production callers).
//!
//! The one invariant every layer preserves (spike §0): **every ambiguity fails
//! toward NOT destroying.** `Keep` is the safe default; the classifier only
//! reaches `Release`/`Delete`/`Archive` on a POSITIVE terminal signal, never on
//! the mere absence of a keep signal. The fail-direction of each row is pinned
//! by the tests below.
//!
//! Extract-and-delegate (spike §5): the classifier COMPOSES sub-verdicts already
//! produced by each system's existing fn — `ReleaseDecision` from
//! [`crate::daemon::auto_release::decide_release`], `releasable_by_invariant`
//! from `auto_release::releasable_by_invariant`, a [`ReclaimState`] from the GC
//! `evaluate_candidate` classification. It re-encodes NONE of that logic; it only
//! adds the cross-system routing that unifies the three decision systems.
//!
//! PR-D narrows D1's blanket `#![allow(dead_code)]` as each call site lands: D2
//! (#2713) wired the L0–L2 auto-release path
//! ([`crate::daemon::auto_release::should_release_now`]); D3 wired the shared L0
//! gate ([`l0_protected`]) + the L4 branch decision ([`branch_disposition`]) into
//! the sweep ([`crate::worktree_cleanup`]); D4 wired the L3 GC reclaim judgment
//! (the GC `evaluate_candidate` produces a [`ReclaimState`] + `agent_alive` and
//! delegates the Keep/Delete/Archive routing here). The ONLY remaining
//! `#[allow(dead_code)]` is on [`ReclaimState::CleanReleaseArchive`] — the
//! removal-time archive-belt outcome the disposition ladder (D5) still routes
//! natively, matched here but not yet constructed outside tests.
